# RPG Combat - TDD Challenge

This repository is the result of my study and practice of **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, through the **RPG Combat** challenge from the [ardalis/kata-catalog](https://github.com/ardalis/kata-catalog).

## About the Challenge

The challenge is to implement a simple RPG combat system following TDD principles. The goal is to build features like character creation, attribute assignment, damage calculation, healing, and character interactions, always guided by unit tests written before production code.

## What I Learned

- **TDD in Practice**: Writing tests first ensures the code is testable and meets requirements from the start.
- **Continuous Refactoring**: With TDD, I could confidently refactor the code, knowing that tests would ensure expected behavior.
- **Code Design**: TDD helped me think about more modular and decoupled code design, making maintenance and extensibility easier.

## Project Structure

- **/src**: Contains the main code for the RPG combat system.
- **/tests**: Unit tests that guided development, written before each feature.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rpg-combat-tdd.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd rpg-combat-tdd
   ```
3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```
